# Basic usage

Google Pay supports taking payments via credit cards. Utilizing the PaymentRequest object, you can handle Shipping Option selection, as well as collect Shipping and Billing addresses.

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <PaymentForm>
      <GooglePay />
    </PaymentForm>
  );
}
```

Different variations of the Google Pay component are available:

import { CreditCard } from 'react-square-web-payments-sdk';
import PaymentForm from '@site/src/components/PaymentForm';

# Basic usage

The Credit Card element makes it easy to accept payments and collect card data on your site. With minimal lines of code you can generate a secure card form that once submitted, generates a one-time-use token that can be used to create a Payment with the CreatePayment API.

```tsx
import { CreditCard } from 'react-square-web-payments-form';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <PaymentForm>
      <CreditCard />
    </PaymentForm>
  );
}
```

## Example

:::caution Test

**We will never store your card data.** But please use dummy data for testing.

:::

:::info

After you hit the `Pay` button you can see the output on the console.

:::

This is how the form looks like:

<PaymentForm>
  <CreditCard
    callbacks={{
      cardBrandChanged(e) {
        console.info(e);
      },
    }}
  />
</PaymentForm>
